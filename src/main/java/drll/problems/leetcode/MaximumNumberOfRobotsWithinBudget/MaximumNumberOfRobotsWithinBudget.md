##### Notes

This problem was very good, I used for the first time a segment tree.

This [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qpUfxVBGaY) was very good to understand the segment tree.
In the [discussion of the exercise](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-robots-within-budget/discuss/2524838/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Sliding-Window-O(n)-Solution)
there is a proposed solution using a Monotonic Queue, I am going to study this way to solve the problem.
