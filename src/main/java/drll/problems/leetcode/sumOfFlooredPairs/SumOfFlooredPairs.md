##### Resume of the problem:

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,5,9]
Output: 10
Explanation:
floor(2 / 5) = floor(2 / 9) = floor(5 / 9) = 0
floor(2 / 2) = floor(5 / 5) = floor(9 / 9) = 1
floor(5 / 2) = 2
floor(9 / 2) = 4
floor(9 / 5) = 1
We calculate the floor of the division for every pair of indices in the array then sum them up.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 49
