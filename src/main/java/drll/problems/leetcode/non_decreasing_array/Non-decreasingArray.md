##### Resume of the problem:

Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).


```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
```
