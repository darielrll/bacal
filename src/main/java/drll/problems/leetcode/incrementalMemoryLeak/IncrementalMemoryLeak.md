```
Example 1:
Input: memory1 = 2, memory2 = 2
Output: [3,1,0]
Explanation: The memory is allocated as follows:
- At the 1st second, 1 bit of memory is allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 1 bit of available memory.
- At the 2nd second, 2 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 0 bits of available memory.
- At the 3rd second, the program crashes. The sticks have 1 and 0 bits available respectively.

Example 2:
Input: memory1 = 8, memory2 = 11
Output: [6,0,4]
Explanation: The memory is allocated as follows:
- At the 1st second, 1 bit of memory is allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 10 bit of available memory.
- At the 2nd second, 2 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 8 bits of available memory.
- At the 3rd second, 3 bits of memory are allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 5 bits of available memory.
- At the 4th second, 4 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 4 bits of available memory.
- At the 5th second, 5 bits of memory are allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 0 bits of available memory.
- At the 6th second, the program crashes. The sticks have 0 and 4 bits available respectively.
