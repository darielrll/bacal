##### Resume of the problem:
 
Given an histogram find the rectangle with the biggest area.
  
##### Notes
 
I started with the naive solution in n2, but obviously raise 
timeout, after that I enchanced the method to find segments with
the same height and in this case this solution approved all test
cases, but, I was not happy with this solution because I made it 
with out using a stack

## Final result

Finally I found the solution using a stack and of course approved 
all test cases.
