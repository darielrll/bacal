##### Resume of the problem:

There are a certain number of cities in a country, some of which are connected 
with bidirectional roads. The number of roads is one less the number of cities, 
and it is possible to travel between any pair of cities using the roads. 
The distance between cities is the minimum number of roads one has to cross 
when traveling between them. How many ways are there to build exactly 3 hotels, 
each in a different city, such that the distance between every pair of hotels 
is equal?

For example, let's say there are n = 5 cities, and roads = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5]]. 
This means that city 1 is connected with roads to all other cities, as seen below:
There are 4 ways to build exactly 3 hotels, each in a different city, 
so that the distance&nbsp; between every pair of hotels is equal:
