 ##### Difficulty Level (according to HackerRank)
 
 > Hard (Algorithms | Implementation )
 
 ##### Resume of the problem:
 Rotate a matrix per layers in anti-clockwise direction
 
 ##### Notes
- Calculate effective rotations (re) = Total rotations% Perimeter of the layer (pc)
- Sense of rotations:
  Â  - Clockwise: re> pc / 2 -> re = pc - re
